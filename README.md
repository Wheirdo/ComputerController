# ComputerController

This program is a work in progress, and in the end I hope it will be a full computer controller. Right now, you can just control another user's mouse, but the other features I want to add is the ability to see the other computer's screen, the ability to type and the ability to click the mouse. 
It works by using multi threading and networking for talking between two computers, along with the MouseInfo class for getting the coordinates of the mouse on the Server side and the Robot class for moving the Client's mouse to the same coordinates.
